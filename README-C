This is a really quick, really crude port of the library for this chipset to C.
Support for interrupts is #ifdef'ed out because it requires integrating some
additional library code for accessing GPIO pins, and I didn't need it for my
project.

I have made no attempts to port any of the examples, and most of the functionality
is entirely untested.

The code itself is in library/ioexpander/ and lives alongside the original
python code for reference.
